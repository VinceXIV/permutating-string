# String Permutation

This project is a solution to the question:
**Given a string S. Write a program that prints al unique permutations of the given string and in an alphabetically sorted manner per permutation**

My solution is a function called `getPermut`. This function accepts a string as an argument and returns and returns it's permutation. For instance, if one calls getPermut with the argument "abc" as follows; `getPermut("abc")`, one should expect the following response;
	 `["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]`

The code has been written in JavaScript, so you'll need to set up an environment supporting it to ran and test it.

To test the code. call the function with any string you wish and `console.log()` the result
